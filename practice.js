/*
Exercise 3-8
Write a program that processes an array of student
objects and determines the grade quartilesâ€”that is,
the grade one would need to score as well as or
better than 25% of the students, 50% of the students,
and 75% of the students.

/*
Ideas
-get grade to be better than 25%
-get grade to be better than 50%
-get grade to be better than 75%

-Quartiles
  sort by grade, then divide by four?????
  e.g. 'better than 25%'
    sort 100 grades from worst to best
    from worst 25 grades, what's the 26 grade?
-wtf are quartiles??
-what 'student' objects???
